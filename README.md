# Running

[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) is required to build and run.

To grab all dependencies required, be sure to first run `npm install`.

A "development" (unminified source code) version can be run using `npm start`. This will also automatically launch a browser window as well as provide automatic compilation and browser refreshes when updating the code.

A "production" (optimized/minimized source) version can be run using `npm run-script serve`. Once run, the project can be viewed by pointing your browser to `localhost:8080`.
